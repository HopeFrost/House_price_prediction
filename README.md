> “The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education”
The Kaggle competition dataset contains 80 qualitative and quantitative features on 1459 houses. A second dataset excluding the sales price provides another 1459 houses to be used as a final testset to submit to the competition.

The project progresses through the Data Science Method steps as follows:
Problem Identification
    When a house goes on the market, how much will it really sell for?
    Homeowners want to know what they’re home is worth. Realtors want to price homes aggressively to sell. Home buyers want to know they’re not overpaying. Everyone involved is interested in market prices and what they’re neighborhood houses are selling for.
